# Stage 1: Intake

Before we begin with the tasks required to complete Step 1, you may want to refer to the following points of interest.

### Points of interest:

Read [the guide](https://docs.poprox.ai/guide/index.html) if you want to learn how to design and implement experiments to run on POPROX.

Consult [the technical reference manual](https://docs.poprox.ai/reference/index.html) for details on APIs, file formats, deployment requirements, and other technical aspects of interfacing with POPROX.

Browse [the project information](https://docs.poprox.ai/project/index.html) to read about the team, the design goals, etc.

Sign up for [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/umn.edu/g/poprox-announce) to receive project announcements.

## Intake Stage

This is the part of the process where a potential experimenter and POPROX determine if a particular study or research question is a good fit for POPROX’s capabilities at the present time.

The Intake Stage is intended to help experimenters clarify their research questions and approach to be compatible with POPROX’s capabilities and to help the POPROX team understand what types of experiments are of interest to the research community.

To learn more about the system and its capabilities, you are welcome to take a look at our system documentation and we welcome inquiries at intake@poprox.ai.

### The Intake Form
A key artifact for this stage of the experimenter experience is the [Intake Form](https://docs.poprox.ai/_downloads/e05a58f57f7856a2c360a554dd7f231a/intake-form.docx). To fill out this form, you will need to be able to specify the research questions that you want to explore and the types of experimental methods you want to apply. Do not worry if you are unclear about how to answer some questions. We expect and accept multiple revisions of the intake form.
