## Purpose
This repository will be the primary means of technical communication between your team and POPROX staff throughout the course of developing, executing, and evaluating your POPROX experiment.

## Contents
* Intake form. This was the document that you initially supplied to get your project approved for intake into the POPROX platform.
* IRB documents:
	* Protocol: We have supplied here a template protcol based on the blanket approval provided by our institutional IRB. You will need to fill in the details of this work and remove sections that do not apply to your work. The protocol must be approved by the local IRB for you and your collaborators. If your experiment design falls outside the blanket approval (see [TODO: documentation link here]), we will also need to seek approval from our IRB for an exception.
	* Approval: This is a placeholder for the approval letter(s) from your local IRB(s). 
* Experiment design. This document specifies the phases of your planned study, the different experimental treatments you will apply, and the groups of users that you are studying. 
* Technical design.
